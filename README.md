# DevOps 0-100: Learn DevOps from Scratch

Welcome to the **DevOps 0-100** repository! This is a comprehensive guide to learning DevOps practices, tools, and methodologies from the ground up.

## 📚 Overview

This repository is designed to take you from zero knowledge to a solid understanding of DevOps practices. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or just getting started in tech, this guide will help you master the essential DevOps skills.

## 🎯 What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. DevOps is complementary with Agile software development; several DevOps aspects came from the Agile methodology.
